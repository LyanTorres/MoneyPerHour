For this week's goal you are able to step throught he sign up process and designate your initial values. If you exit and re-enter the app it doesn't make you do that a second time because those bits of information is being stored in user defaults

You could also press the edit icon on the top right and override your previous inputs 

Nothing else is working up until this point.
